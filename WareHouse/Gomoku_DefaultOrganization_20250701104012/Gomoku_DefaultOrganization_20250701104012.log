[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a static HTML web page for 'RetroGameHub'. It should display a list of at least 5 classic arcade games (e.g., Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong). Each game should have its name as a heading (H2) and a short 1-2 sentence description as a paragraph. The page needs minimal CSS to give it a pixel-art, 8-bit retro theme: use a blocky font, pixelated borders, and a dark background with bright, contrasting text colors. The layout should be simple, just a stacked list of games. Ensure the HTML is well-formed and the CSS is in a separate style.css file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a static HTML web page for 'RetroGameHub'. It should display a list of at least 5 classic arcade games (e.g., Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong). Each game should have its name as a heading (H2) and a short 1-2 sentence description as a paragraph. The page needs minimal CSS to give it a pixel-art, 8-bit retro theme: use a blocky font, pixelated borders, and a dark background with bright, contrasting text colors. The layout should be simple, just a stacked list of games. Ensure the HTML is well-formed and the CSS is in a separate style.css file.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " HTML/CSS"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  HTML/CSS. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a static HTML web page for 'RetroGameHub'. It should display a list of at least 5 classic arcade games (e.g., Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong). Each game should have its name as a heading (H2) and a short 1-2 sentence description as a paragraph. The page needs minimal CSS to give it a pixel-art, 8-bit retro theme: use a blocky font, pixelated borders, and a dark background with bright, contrasting text colors. The layout should be simple, just a stacked list of games. Ensure the HTML is well-formed and the CSS is in a separate style.css file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<comment>
The highest priority issue is the paragraph text size being too small (0.75em) for comfortable reading, especially with the pixel-style font. While maintaining retro aesthetics is important, readability should not be compromised. 

Suggestion: Increase paragraph font-size to 0.9em and add letter-spacing for better legibility:

style.css (revised p selector):
```css
p {
    font-size: 0.9em;
    letter-spacing: 0.5px;
    color: #00ff00;
    margin: 0;
    line-height: 1.8;
}
```

This maintains the retro feel while improving accessibility. The 'Press Start 2P' font's inherent chunkiness requires slightly larger sizes for clear reading.

Comments on Codes:
"<comment>
The highest priority issue is the paragraph text size being too small (0.75em) for comfortable reading, especially with the pixel-style font. While maintaining retro aesthetics is important, readability should not be compromised. 

Suggestion: Increase paragraph font-size to 0.9em and add letter-spacing for better legibility:

style.css (revised p selector):
```css
p {
    font-size: 0.9em;
    letter-spacing: 0.5px;
    color: #00ff00;
    margin: 0;
    line-height: 1.8;
}
```

This maintains the retro feel while improving accessibility. The 'Press Start 2P' font's inherent chunkiness requires slightly larger sizes for clear reading.
</comment>"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Each game should have its name as a heading (H2) and a short 1-2 sentence description as a paragraph. The page needs minimal CSS to give it a pixel-art, 8-bit retro theme: use a blocky font, pixelated borders, and a dark background with bright, contrasting text colors. The layout should be simple, just a stacked list of games. Ensure the HTML is well-formed and the CSS is in a separate style.css file. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a static HTML web page for 'RetroGameHub'. It should display a list of at least 5 classic arcade games (e.g., Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong). Each game should have its name as a heading (H2) and a short 1-2 sentence description as a paragraph. The page needs minimal CSS to give it a pixel-art, 8-bit retro theme: use a blocky font, pixelated borders, and a dark background with bright, contrasting text colors. The layout should be simple, just a stacked list of games. Ensure the HTML is well-formed and the CSS is in a separate style.css file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a static HTML web page for 'RetroGameHub'. It should display a list of at least 5 classic arcade games (e.g., Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong). Each game should have its name as a heading (H2) and a short 1-2 sentence description as a paragraph. The page needs minimal CSS to give it a pixel-art, 8-bit retro theme: use a blocky font, pixelated borders, and a dark background with bright, contrasting text colors. The layout should be simple, just a stacked list of games. Ensure the HTML is well-formed and the CSS is in a separate style.css file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a static HTML web page for 'RetroGameHub'. It should display a list of at least 5 classic arcade games (e.g., Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong). Each game should have its name as a heading (H2) and a short 1-2 sentence description as a paragraph. The page needs minimal CSS to give it a pixel-art, 8-bit retro theme: use a blocky font, pixelated borders, and a dark background with bright, contrasting text colors. The layout should be simple, just a stacked list of games. Ensure the HTML is well-formed and the CSS is in a separate style.css file..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

For a static HTML/CSS website project like RetroGameHub, there are typically no external package dependencies required since it runs directly in web browsers. However, if we consider potential development tools or formatters, we might include:

requirements.txt
```
# No Python dependencies required for static site
# Optional linter/formatter for code quality:
# csslint==1.0.5
# html5validator==0.3.3
```

This file intentionally left blank since:
1. The project uses only native web technologies (HTML5/CSS3)
2. External resources (fonts) are loaded via CDN
3. No server-side processing or build tools are required

Would you like me to suggest any complementary development dependencies or tooling configurations instead?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Create a static HTML web page for 'RetroGameHub'. It should display a list of at least 5 classic arcade games (e.g., Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong). Each game should have its name as a heading (H2) and a short 1-2 sentence description as a paragraph. The page needs minimal CSS to give it a pixel-art, 8-bit retro theme: use a blocky font, pixelated borders, and a dark background with bright, contrasting text colors. The layout should be simple, just a stacked list of games. Ensure the HTML is well-formed and the CSS is in a separate style.css file..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  
1. **Analyze Project Requirements**: Static HTML/CSS site with no server-side processing  
2. **Identify Dependencies**: No runtime dependencies needed (browser-native technologies)  
3. **Consider Development Tools**: Optional linters/formatters could be noted as comments  
4. **Document Rationale**: Explicitly state why dependencies aren't required  

**Final requirements.txt**  
```text
# RetroGameHub Project Requirements
# No Python/Node.js dependencies required - static HTML/CSS site

# Optional development tools (uncomment if needed):
# csslint==1.0.5          # CSS code quality checker
# html5validator==0.3.3   # HTML5 markup validation
# prettier==3.2.5         # Code formatter (with --plugin-search-dir=.)

# External resources handled via CDN:
# - 'Press Start 2P' font from Google Fonts
# - No build tools required
```

This solution:  
- Clearly communicates the lack of required dependencies  
- Provides optional tooling suggestions as commented-out entries  
- Documents font handling approach  
- Maintains compatibility with the existing project structure

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
