Create a static HTML web page for 'RetroGameHub'. It should display a list of at least 5 classic arcade games (e.g., Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong). Each game should have its name as a heading (H2) and a short 1-2 sentence description as a paragraph. The page needs minimal CSS to give it a pixel-art, 8-bit retro theme: use a blocky font, pixelated borders, and a dark background with bright, contrasting text colors. The layout should be simple, just a stacked list of games. Ensure the HTML is well-formed and the CSS is in a separate style.css file.
